traits. Returns an array of type T that has been sorted. It has two 
loops, one nested in the other. The outer loop sets an immutable 
variable, val, to the value of the ith index and sets a mutable variable 
j to the value of i - 1. The inner loop executes while j +1 != 0
the length of the array and while the value of the jth element is 
greater than the value of val, and sets the value of the element to
the &quot;right&quot; of j to the value of the jth element. j is then decremented.
When j is equal to zero and decrments, it will fulfill the first
termination condition of the inner while loop. After the termination
of the inner loop, the element to the right of the jth element is
assigned the value of val, and i increments.</p>

pushed onto a result array, and the first element will shifted from
the array. Else, whichever array holds elements will successively have
its first element pushed onto the result and be shifted. Note that
this behavior is dependent on the arrays already being sorted, either
by previous merges or by another method of sorting.</p>

pass 1 as an argument for the minimum size. Takes an array of type T
which implements Ord and Clone traits, and returns an array of type T.
It recursively slices the given array to two arrays of half that size,
until those arrays are of the minimum length, then calls insertion_sort
to sort those arrays. Those sorted arrays are then merged until an
array of equal length to the original is returned. So if you pass
an array with 128 elements and pass 32 as min_size, it&#39;ll split it
into two arrays holding 64 elements, then the first array will be split
into two arrays holding 32 elements, then those arrays will be sorted
with insertion sort, and merged. This will be repeated for the other
array holding 64 elements, and then these two sorted arrays will
be merged and returned.</p>

to the element next to it. If the element is smaller, then that index
is marked as the smallest, until either another smaller element is found
or the loop terminates with the last element. After the inner loop
terminates, the values of the ith index and the index holding the
smallest element are swapped, provided they actually differ. i is then
incremented, and the outer loop proceeds in this fashion until every
element has been examined.</p>
